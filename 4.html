        <h1>HTML Styles - CSS</h1>
        <p>
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.

        <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
        <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.

            With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!  
        </p>
        <h2>Using CSS</h2>
        <p>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

            Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
            Internal - by using a style element in the head section
            External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file
            The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, because this is easier to demonstrate, 
            and easier for you to try it yourself.
